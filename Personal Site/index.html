    <h1>Hello! I am Zander Borrelli</h1>

    <p>I am a 16 year old male from Canton New York. I am writing this biography for a project for my Computer & Infromation Sciences class at the Boces Seaway Tech Center. I have always enjoyed using the internet for various cenarios, such as watching YouTube Videos, Playing games, or just reading about the latest news. Learning how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will help me for my future when I get into college for Cyber Security.</p>
    <p>I was Born in Ogdensburg New York on April, 27th 2009. I live outside of canton New York with my mother, step-father, and four siblings. We have one black cat named Midnight, and a white dog with brown spots named Patches.</p>
    <p>I want to learn the different coding languages so I can help buisnesses secure their data, and help them out with their technological needs.</p>

    <p>Here is a quote from one of my favorite fictional characters:</p>
    <blockquote>"We All Have The Right To Choose Our Own Future. We Should Be Able To Walk The Paths That We Choose, Not The Future You've Decided For Us."</blockquote>
    <p>Natsu Dragneel, <cite>Fairy Tail By, Hiro Mashima</cite></p>
